This Projects regarding data Analytics


# TASK 1:

By creating and analysing this data we can come to know that:
Email marketing is the best marketing stratagy for getting more customers.
New customers are attracted more.


# TASK 2:


This task is basically creating few visualizations for the same pivot table that we created in the previous task.
Creating a visualizations in excel is not much harder as we think.
when you click anywhere in the pivot table On the top menu you will notice a tab called Pivot Table Analyze click on this tab.
Top right you will see Pivot chart.
when you click on this tab a visualization is automatically created you can see this in a small pop up window on the screen.
if you want to change to a different visualization then right click on the visualization that poped up.
In the menu check for > Change chart type > 
  All different types of chart forms are shown ex: column, line, pie, waterfall, combo, maps etc..
  choose ypur opption.


Similarly create two more visualizations using the same process.

Then In the task 2 you will find a powerpoint sample download this and add vilualizations. 
Clearly mention the preferable names for the visualizations obtained.
Finally add a good recomondation and you are good to submit.


Here are some recomondations:

# Analysis Report:

1. New vs. Existing Customers

Focus on Retention First: Acquiring new customers is usually 5–7x more expensive than retaining existing ones. Build loyalty programs, personalized offers, and post-purchase engagement to maximize lifetime value (LTV).

Optimize Acquisition Channels: For new customers, double down on channels that yield the highest conversion (e.g., targeted digital ads, referral programs, or partnerships).

Segmentation Strategy: Create separate journeys for new and returning customers. New customers need more onboarding/education; existing customers need more upsell/cross-sell.

2. Sales vs. Marketing

Align Messaging: Marketing should focus on awareness and lead generation; Sales should convert those leads into actual revenue. Joint KPIs can help avoid siloed performance metrics.

Data-Driven Targeting: Marketing campaigns should be designed using customer data insights from sales (e.g., common objections, buying cycles).

Feedback Loop: Establish regular syncs where Sales informs Marketing about lead quality and messaging effectiveness — this closes the gap and improves ROI.

3. Customer Journey Enhancement

Onboarding for New Customers: Simplify the first experience (e.g., tutorials, welcome offers, guided product setup).

Engagement for Existing Customers: Offer personalized recommendations and early access to new features/products.

Loyalty Programs: Reward existing customers with tiered incentives, discounts, or exclusive perks to reduce churn.

4. Strategic Growth Recommendations

Balance Acquisition & Retention: Target 60% focus on retaining/expanding existing customer base and 40% on acquiring new customers — this balances growth and profitability.

Cross-Selling Opportunities: Use data from existing customers to introduce complementary products/services.

Customer Advocacy: Encourage satisfied customers to become advocates through referral programs, reviews, and testimonials.
